\section{User of the System}
The major design goal of the SEDA encouraged the participation of the user. Therefore, the SEDA was designed solely for using as a personal gadget that everyone could buy at local consumer electronic store. A user with enough technical background could able to operate their own instance of the SEDA cloud intelligence service by following the operational manual. Otherwise, a user subscribed to the third party service provider for secured access of their private driving profile data. This idea reassembled to the popular sport wear Fitbit sharing of a user sport activities and their health statistics.

Besides as a personal gadget, if the user decided to disclose their driving profile (a good driving behaviour) for a car insurance company, this could negotiate an incentive for insurance premium as a proven evidence for safe and good behaving driving record.

The enforcing body like VicRoads could also use the SEDA to train a better safer driver.

Furthermore, the SEDA could more generalized its use by not only for a car driver but also for any driver in a good behaving driving needs such as Cyclist, Motorbike and so on.
