%Quick instant instruction when driving
%Long run feedback on data collected

The device prototype, the SEDA and the related software systems are part of a design fiction \cite{designfiction}. However, the features we discussed are doable within reasonable near future. Some part of the features such as image recognition, behaviour modeling are becoming ubiquitous computing nowadays. We also like to emphasize that the SEDA physical propriety such as light weight, lower power usage, easy to tag along with the user are all that serious design consideration if the device is put up for manufacturing. We believe that not only the SEDA can help the user to get a really good driving behaviour but also the user can transfer this knowledge to others and embrace the safer future.
